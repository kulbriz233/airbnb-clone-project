# Airbnb Clone Project

This is a front-end clone of the Airbnb website built as a project to practice UI development, responsive design, and modern front-end architecture. The goal is to replicate the core layout and functionality of the Airbnb platform — think listings, booking cards, search, and maybe even a date picker.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Recreate the Airbnb homepage UI
- Implement listing cards and navigation
- Add filter/search functionality
- Mobile responsiveness
- Stretch Goal: Add backend integration for listings

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React** – Front-end library for building UI
- **React Router** – For page routing/navigation

## 📦 Installation!

```bash
git clone https://https://github.com/kulbriz233/airbnb-clone-project.git
cd airbnb-clone-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Planning

This section outlines the visual and functional design strategy for the Airbnb Clone Project. The goal is to build an interface that not only looks modern and clean but also supports a smooth and intuitive booking experience across all devices.

### 🗂 Primary Pages Overview

| Page Name               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### 💡 Importance of User-Friendly Design

A well-designed booking system **reduces friction**, **builds user trust**, and **boosts conversion rates**. For a product that handles real money and real plans, clarity and ease of use are non-negotiable. Users should never feel lost — they should feel guided. Clean navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive layouts are key to a smooth customer journey.

### 🧠 Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mockup

Identifying and clearly defining the **design properties** of a mockup is essential for multiple reasons:

1. **Consistency:** Establishing color palettes, font styles, and component structures in the mockup helps maintain a cohesive look throughout the app. Without this, each page or element can end up looking mismatched, leading to a disjointed user experience.

2. **Guidance for Developers:** Clear design properties act as a blueprint for developers, ensuring they implement the UI as envisioned. This includes knowing font sizes, color codes, margins, and layout styles — basically making sure the front-end matches the design exactly.

3. **Responsive Design:** By defining how elements will adjust to different screen sizes in a mockup (like breakpoints, reflowing text, or stacking elements), we can ensure that the design will work on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.

4. **Speed & Efficiency:** When the design properties are already clearly set in the mockup, it saves time in both development and future updates. Developers and designers don’t need to go back and forth making design decisions — everything is defined up front.

This planning ensures that the product's development process remains organized, efficient, and true to the original design intent.
