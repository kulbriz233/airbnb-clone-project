# Airbnb Clone Project

This is a front-end clone of the Airbnb website built as a project to practice UI development, responsive design, and modern front-end architecture.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Recreate the Airbnb homepage UI
- Implement listing cards and navigation
- Add filter/search functionality
- Mobile responsiveness

A well-designed booking system **reduces friction**, **builds user trust**, and **boosts conversion rates**. For a product that handles real money and real plans, clarity and ease of use are non-negotiable. Users should never feel lost — they should feel guided.
