# Airbnb Clone Project

This is a front-end clone of the Airbnb website built as a project to practice UI development, responsive design, and modern front-end architecture. The goal is to replicate the core layout and functionality of the Airbnb platform — think listings, booking cards, search, and maybe even a date picker.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Recreate the Airbnb homepage UI
- Implement listing cards and navigation
- Add filter/search functionality
- Mobile responsiveness
- Stretch Goal: Add backend integration for listings

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React** – Front-end library for building UI
- **React Router** – For page routing/navigation

## 📦 Installation!

```bash
git clone https://https://github.com/kulbriz233/airbnb-clone-project.git
cd airbnb-clone-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Planning

This section outlines the visual and functional design strategy for the Airbnb Clone Project. The goal is to build an interface that not only looks modern and clean but also supports a smooth and intuitive booking experience across all devices.

---

### 🧭 Design Goals

- ✅ Create an intuitive and seamless booking flow  
- ✅ Maintain visual consistency across all pages  
- ✅ Ensure fast loading times and performance  
- ✅ Prioritize responsive design for mobile-first experience  

---

### 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 Property search and filtering  
- 🏡 Detailed property viewing with images and amenities  
- 🔐 Secure checkout and booking confirmation process  
- 👤 User authentication for login, signup, and profile access

### 🗂 Primary Pages Overview

| Page Name               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Grid display of available properties with filters for price, location, and ratings |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Complete property info with large images, host details, booking form, and amenities |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Streamlined payment form with booking confirmation and cost breakdown     |

---

### 💡 Importance of User-Friendly Design

A well-designed booking system **reduces friction**, **builds user trust**, and **boosts conversion rates**. For a product that handles real money and real plans, clarity and ease of use are non-negotiable. Users should never feel lost — they should feel guided. Clean navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive layouts are key to a smooth customer journey.

### 🎨 Figma Design Specifications

**Color Styles**  
Here are the primary colors used throughout the design:

- **Primary:** `#FF5A5F`  
- **Secondary:** `#008489`  
- **Background:** `#FFFFFF`  
- **Text:** `#222222`  
- **Secondary Text:** `#717171`  

**Typography**  
This is the type system used to maintain readability and hierarchy across the UI:

- **Primary Font Family:** Circular  
  - **Font Weight:** Medium (500)  
  - **Font Size:** 16px
- **Headings Font Family:** Circular  
  - **Font Weight:** Bold (700)  
  - **Font Size:** 24px - 32px (varies by section)
- **Secondary Text Font Family:** Circular

### 🧠 Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mockup

Identifying and clearly defining the **design properties** of a mockup is essential for multiple reasons:

1. **Consistency:** Establishing color palettes, font styles, and component structures in the mockup helps maintain a cohesive look throughout the app. Without this, each page or element can end up looking mismatched, leading to a disjointed user experience.

2. **Guidance for Developers:** Clear design properties act as a blueprint for developers, ensuring they implement the UI as envisioned. This includes knowing font sizes, color codes, margins, and layout styles — basically making sure the front-end matches the design exactly.

3. **Responsive Design:** By defining how elements will adjust to different screen sizes in a mockup (like breakpoints, reflowing text, or stacking elements), we can ensure that the design will work on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.

4. **Speed & Efficiency:** When the design properties are already clearly set in the mockup, it saves time in both development and future updates. Developers and designers don’t need to go back and forth making design decisions — everything is defined up front.

This planning ensures that the product's development process remains organized, efficient, and true to the original design intent.

### 👥 Project Roles and Responsibilities

This section defines the key roles involved in the development of the Airbnb Clone Project and how each contributes to the overall success of the project.

| Roles              | Responsibilities |
|--------------------|------------------|
| **Project Manager** | Ensures the project stays on track by managing timelines, coordinating tasks across teams, and overseeing deliverables. Acts as the central point of communication between all stakeholders to maintain momentum. |
| **Frontend Developers** | Responsible for translating the UI/UX designs into responsive, interactive components using technologies like React. They ensure the app looks and behaves consistently across devices and browsers. |
| **Backend Developers** | Handle server-side logic, database integration, and API development. Their job is to ensure smooth communication between the client-side and server, and implement core business logic. |
| **Designers** | Create Figma mockups, wireframes, and high-fidelity prototypes. They ensure the visual consistency of the brand, focus on user experience, and maintain an accessible, intuitive interface design system. |
| **QA/Testers** | Write test plans, perform manual and automated testing, and identify bugs before release. Their work ensures the reliability, stability, and performance of the application in all user flows. |
| **DevOps Engineers** | Set up and manage deployment pipelines (CI/CD), cloud infrastructure, and system monitoring. They make sure the application is scalable, secure, and running efficiently in production. |
| **Product Owner** | Defines the product vision and prioritizes the feature roadmap. Works closely with developers and designers to ensure business goals align with the user needs. Represents stakeholder interests throughout development. |
| **Scrum Master** | Facilitates Agile ceremonies (daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives), removes team blockers, and ensures the team follows Agile principles for better collaboration and faster delivery. |

### 🧩 UI Component Patterns

The Airbnb Clone project will be built using modular, reusable UI components to maintain consistency, improve scalability, and speed up development. Below are the primary components we plan to implement:

---

#### 🔝 Navbar

A sticky, responsive navigation bar that appears across all pages.

**Features:**
- Site logo
- Search bar for quick property lookup
- User navigation options (Login, Profile, Host a Home)
- Hamburger menu for mobile screens

---

#### 🏘️ Property Card

Displays a snapshot of a property in grid views (e.g., search results).

**Features:**
- Featured property image
- Price per night
- Location and title
- Star rating
- Favorite (heart) icon
- Responsive layout that adjusts to screen sizes

---

#### 📄 Footer

A consistent footer displayed at the bottom of all pages.

**Features:**
- Navigation links (About, Terms, Privacy, Help, etc.)
- Social media icons
- Company branding
- Copyright information

---

Each component will follow the design guidelines from the Figma mockup and will be built for **reusability**, **accessibility**, and **performance**.

Additional components such as buttons, modals, date pickers, and form fields will be added as development progresses and aligned with design system standards.
